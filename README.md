# flutter_whatsapp_clone

A flutter based chat app inspired by whatsapp. 

It uses Google Firebase services on the back-end. 

It's not polished enough to be released. I just wanted to test my skills to see if I can handle to build a live messaging application by myself.

## Getting Started

All you have to do is run the code on an android emulator. You can use VSCode or Android Studio as compiler. 

Or you can download the apk file.
